# Markdown Preview Studio

A single-page Markdown previewer with a GitHub-style theme. Paste Markdown or load a file, then copy or download the
rendered HTML.

## How to use

1. Paste Markdown into the left panel or click "Load file" to import a `.md` file.
2. View the GitHub-style preview on the right.
3. Copy rendered HTML or download it as a standalone HTML fragment.

## Notes

- Content stays in your browser; no uploads.
- The current Markdown is stored in the URL hash for easy sharing.
- Uses `marked`, `dompurify`, and `github-markdown-css` from CDNs.
